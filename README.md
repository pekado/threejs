We have a designer who is working in Blender. He can provide assets if you need them later in the week (attaching examples of the art we will be using).

Here is a requirements list. Start at the bottom and work your way down.

    Create base app
    Create User Profile page
        Add form with name and email input
        Save user profile to local storage (or DB if you choose)
    Create game play page
        Add character (EA logo)
        Support character movement
        Support basic collision detection (walls)
        Add points to profile for hitting checkpoints
    Integrate Blender graphics

The end goal of this project would be something like https://bruno-simon.com.
